Cache operations made developer friendly, in Kirby CMS.

Just visit an url to make a cache operation, for example `/flush`. You will get a JSON response back. It's simple for both users and computers to read the results.

## Operations

### Flush

**Url:** `/flush`

This operation flushes both `cache` and `thumbs` by default. You can change it to flush any folder.

**Path**

To flush the cache you by default need to visit `/flush`. It can be changed to a path that you prefer.

```php
c::set('cache.rest.flush.path', 'flush');
```

**Roots**

```php
global $kirby;
c::set('cache.rest.flush.roots', [
    $kirby->roots()->cache(),
    $kirby->roots()->thumbs()
]);
```

## Additional options

### lock

When lock is enabled, the operations will only be accessible by users logged in to the panel.

```php
c::set('cache.rest.flush.lock', false);
```
